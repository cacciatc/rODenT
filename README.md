What A Rodent Is Good For
=========================
* Notifying you that you that it is time to change apartments.
* Feeding Napoleonic-era maritime crews when the weevily biscuits are gone.
* Scurrying inside ODT documents and retrieving helpful elements like: paragraphs, lists, tables, and footnotes.

What A Rodent Is Bad For
========================
* Scurrying inside ODT documents with a new element in its dirty little mouth (or at least not supported at the moment.)
* Being predictable (API will probably change soon.)
